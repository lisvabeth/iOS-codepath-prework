Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- My major challenge was starting it, as Xcode was already having troubles installing. But besides that, everything was well put. Another challenge I can say was the simulator. Sometimes it runs and sometimes it doesn't. I am new to this enviorment but I found it nice and settling with the amount of resources and info (especailly the pictures and gifs!) given for this project.
